# Tensorflow KNN
An extension for [Xcratch](https://xcratch.github.io/) that provides K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification capabilities using TensorFlow.js ([GitHub - tfjs-models/knn-classifier](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/knn-classifier)).

This extension allows you to train a KNN model by adding examples with labels and then classify new data points based on the learned examples.

## ‚ú® What You Can Do With This Extension

*   **Train a KNN Model:** Add data points (as strings of numbers) associated with specific labels.
*   **Classify Data:** Predict the label for new data points using the trained model.
*   **Inspect the Model:** Get information about the number of labels, examples per label, and the dimensions of the data.
*   **Analyze Predictions:** Retrieve the predicted label and the confidence scores for each label.
*   **Persist the Model:** Save the trained dataset to a Scratch list (`KNN Dataset`) or download it as a file, and load it back later.
*   **Integrate with Lists:** Easily use data directly from Scratch lists as input for examples or predictions.

## Blocks

### Training Blocks

*   `add example [DATA] with label [LABEL]`: Adds a data example (string of numbers or array) to the classifier under the specified label. The data will be automatically stored in the "KNN Dataset" list.
*   `clear examples for [LABEL]`: Removes all examples associated with the specified label from the classifier.

### Data Blocks

*   `size of an example`: Reports the number of dimensions (features) expected for each data example. Returns 0 if no examples have been added yet.
*   `KNN data from [LIST_NAME]`: Converts a Scratch list into a string format suitable for the `[DATA]` input. This block accepts a list name from the dropdown menu.

### Prediction Blocks

*   `predict [DATA] with [K] nearest neighbors`: Classifies the given data using the specified number of neighbors (K) and updates the prediction results. Returns a status message with the predicted label and confidence.
*   `label`: Reports the most likely label from the last prediction. Returns a space character if no prediction has been made yet.
*   `confidence of [LABEL]`: Reports the confidence score (0-1) for the specified label from the last prediction. Returns 0 if the label doesn't exist or no prediction has been made.

### Information Blocks

*   `label at [INDEX]`: Reports the name of the label at the given index (1-based) in the list of all known labels. Returns an empty string if the index is out of range.
*   `size of labels`: Reports the total number of unique labels known to the classifier.
*   `size of example for [LABEL]`: Reports the number of examples added for the specified label. Returns 0 if the label doesn't exist.

### Dataset Management Blocks

*   `store dataset in list`: Saves the current classifier dataset into a list named "KNN Dataset" in the current sprite. This list is automatically loaded when the project starts.
*   `save dataset`: Downloads the current classifier dataset as a JSON file. Prompts for a filename and automatically adds `.json` extension if not provided.
*   `load dataset`: Opens a file dialog to load a previously saved classifier dataset from a JSON file. The dataset will be loaded into the classifier and can be used immediately.
